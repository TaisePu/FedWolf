Correction
Code for paper - **[Dynamic Adaptive Federated Learning on Local Long-Tailed Data]**

## Prerequisite

NVIDIA 4090

NVIDIA Driver 520.56.06

python 3.8.0

CUDA 11.8

torch 2.0.1

## Datasets
CIFAR10/100

ImageNet1000

CIFAR is easyï¼Œit will be downloaded automatically to /Folder/Data/Raw/

ImageNet1000 (ILSVRC2012) needs be downloaded from this [link](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) and put all files to /Folder/Data/Raw/

Make sure PATH in options.py is right.

Then, you can follow the following steps to run the experiments:

    ```
    python fedwolf.py
    ```

Results in ./Results
